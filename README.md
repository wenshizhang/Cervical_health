#DESCRIPTION
Today I feel so tired when I coding, my eyes and my cervical...

So I decide to write a script to control screenlock once a hour.When the screen is locked, I can walk around, drink water and take a look at outside of the windows.

#SCRIPT
Here is one script ,called need. In the script, only one command, it can lock your screen only under the other user node, I don't know why it doesn't work for root user

#NOTE
It can run once an hour only when you put it in the cron.hourly directory.
